**Module 1 – IT Support**
## Module 1 Summary 

Module 1 focused on the core responsibilities of an entry-level IT Support / Helpdesk role, including basic troubleshooting, operating system fundamentals, and clear communication with users.

During this module, I created realistic service desk tickets to practice documenting common support scenarios such as slow system performance, identifying operating systems, and distinguishing between hardware and software issues. Each ticket follows a structured troubleshooting approach, from initial user report through resolution and verification.

These examples reflect typical Tier 1 helpdesk tasks and demonstrate my ability to think logically, communicate clearly, and document issues in a professional support environment.

## Tickets Included
- Startup slow performance troubleshooting
- Operating system identification
- Hardware vs software issue diagnosis
