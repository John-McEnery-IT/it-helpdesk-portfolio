# Module 2 – Summary

Module 2 focused on core networking concepts and common connectivity issues encountered in a Tier 1 IT Support environment. Topics included Wi-Fi and wired network troubleshooting, IP addressing, DHCP behavior, and remote access via VPN.

During this module, I documented realistic helpdesk tickets covering frequent networking scenarios such as inability to connect to Wi-Fi, connectivity without internet access, devices receiving 169.254.x.x IP addresses, and VPN connection failures for remote users. Each ticket demonstrates a structured troubleshooting approach, proper escalation decisions, and clear communication with users.

These examples reflect real-world networking issues handled by entry-level IT support technicians and highlight my ability to diagnose connectivity problems, apply foundational networking knowledge, and document support activities in a professional service desk context.

## Tickets Included
- Unable to connect to Wi-Fi
